Hi there!

Thanks for checking out our game! We appreciate it.

Story:
I have fond memories of playing with my Tamagotchi toy back in the 90's and wanted to combine my enjoyment of fish keeping with that. And so was born Pokaquarium (your virtual fish tank). 
I'd define it as an action puzzle game, as you have to not only catch coins as they drop from the pets, but also manage your food stock, your medicine supply and keep their hunger at bay.

On average, a game could take 20mins to play, as the game starts slowly and eases you into it, then gets a little more manic as you get more pets to manage. 
This is definitely a casual game, so if you are looking for a quick 5 minute game, this is probably not for you.

Instructions:
left/right - Move crab
up - feed pets
down - give medicine to pets
a - buy food - 1 coin
b - buy medicine - 3 coins
c - buy pet - 10 coins

More detail:
You start off with one pet. The aim is to buy X amount of pets for you to be promoted to a new aquarium which will in turn require more pets to purchase.
More pets make the hunger go down quicker, as more pets eat more food.
To top up their hunger, push Up to feed them one unit of food which tops of two units of hunger.
Healthy pets drop coins at random. 
Heal all sick fish by pushing Down to apply medicine.
If you run out of hunger, you lose a single pet and your saved coins, but hunger is restored. If you lose your last pet, it's game over.

Interface:
1 - food level
2 - hunger level
3 - coins earned
4 - medicine bought
5 - score

My suggestions/tips:
1. Buy and keep at least 1 medicine at all times, as pets randomly get sick and if sick, do not drop coins.
2. Know when to upgrade. You can stay with one pet and collect coins and then buy as many pets as you can afford in one go, but it will take a lot longer to finish the level that way. 
Instead, save up enough coins to cover a new pet, one medicine and some food stock, otherwise you gamble losing something.

Enjoy!
